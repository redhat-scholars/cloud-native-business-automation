= Build Decision Service Logic
include::_attributes.adoc[]

In this lab you are going to create a new decision logic from scratch.
The main goal is to learn how to build a decision logic taking advantage of the powerful DMN notation.

Before proceeding, you can also review the following tutorials to get a first introduction to the DMN basis:

https://learn-dmn-in-15-minutes.com/[Learn DMN in 15 minutes]

WARNING: This hands on is not going to give you a step by step guidance on how to craft the DMN, it's structured as a *puzzle* that you have to solve with some hints.

[#challenge]
== Challenge description

> A *Cart* contains multiple items, an item is defined by a _category_ and a _price_. The outcome of the decision is the *Final Price* of the cart. A first discount is evaluated on every item in the cart depending on the category: for the _food_ category, the discount is 5% if the price is more than 19 otherwise 2%; for all other categories the discount is 10% if the price is more than 15. Finally, if the overall amount of the cart (after the item discount) is more than 70 then apply an extra discount of 10%. 

Start creating the file: `discount.dmn` inside the project created in the previous hands on.

TIP: The folder for DMN and BPMN artefacts is: `src/main/resources/`.

[#hints]
== Hints

=== Create the Data Types

Add:

- The type for the item: `tItem` with `category` and `price`
- The type for the list of item: `tItemList`
- The type for the list of numbers 

=== Create the Decision Requirement Graph

- The input is the *Cart* which is a list of item.
- The output is a decision called *Final Price* which is a number.
- Create a Business Knowledge Model called *Discount*, which goal is to compute the discount for an item.

=== Implement the Decision Nodes

Open the *Discount* BKM:

- the input parameter is `item` typed `tItem`
- the output is a `number`
- the core of the BKM can be implemented as a decision table:
  
  1. Input clause `item.category` (string)
  2. Input clause `item.price` (number)
  3. Output clause `Discount` (number)

Open the *Final Price* decision node:

- Select `context` as logic type
- Implement the following entries:
  - `discounted prices` the list with the discounted prices
  - `discounted total` the sum of the discounted prices

==== FEEL syntax reminder:

A BKM is function, the syntax is: `Discount(item)`

The *for* loop expression iterates over lists of elements or ranges of numbers. The general syntax is:

```
for i 1 in ic return e
```

where `ic` stands for iteration context and can be:

- a list
- a range e.g. `1..10`

The function `sum` return sum of numbers:

```
list = [1,2,3]
sum(list) -> 6
```

[#run-locally]
== Run locally the Decision Service

1. *Start* quarkus in dev mode:
+
[.console-input]
[source,shell]
----
mvn quarkus:dev
----

2. *Create* the file: `src/test/resources/dmn-test.http` with the following content:
+
[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
POST http://localhost:8080/discount
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
   "Cart": [
      {
      "category": "electronics",
      "price": 80
      },
      {
      "category": "food",
      "price": 20
      }
   ]
}
----

3. *Click* on the `Send request` link to probe the DMN service. 
In the result page you should spot: `"Final Price": 81.9`
+
TIP: If you haven't installed the _Rest Client_ plug-in, you can probe the DMN service through the _Swagger UI_: `http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/`

[#test]
== Create a Test Scenario

1. *Add* to the `pom.xml` file the following dependency:
+
[.console-input]
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
   <artifactId>kogito-scenario-simulation</artifactId>
   <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

2. *Create* the Java class `KogitoScenarioJUnitActivatorTest.java` in the folder `src/test/java/testscenario`

3. *Add* the annotation `@RunWith` as in the snippet:
+
[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.kogito.scenariosimulation.runner.KogitoJunitActivator;

@RunWith(KogitoJunitActivator.class)
public class KogitoScenarioJunitActivatorTest {
----

4. *Create* the file `DiscountTS.scesim` in the folder `src/test/resources/`

5. In the dialogue box `Create Test Scenario`
- *Select* `DMN`, then `discount.dmn` and `Create` button.
+
image::dmn-ts.png[test scenario,800,align="center"]
- You should get a quite simple table with a column named *GIVEN* and another named *EXPECTED*.

6. In the *GIVEN* column, *double click* on the last cell (there is a place holder text: _Insert value_)
   
- In the pop up window, *select* `Add list value`
- *Type* `"food"` in the category field (make sure to type the double quote `"`)
- *Type* `20` in the price field
- *Click* the confirmation button (check mark)
- *Click* the `Save` button
+
image::dmn-list-value.png[list value,600,align="center"]

7. In the *EXPECTED* column, *double click* on the last cell (there is a place holder text: _Insert value_)

- *Type* `0`

8. From a terminal *launch* the tests: `mvn clean test`

9. You should get a failure message: `KogitoScenarioJunitActivatorTest #1: Failed in "Final Price": The expected value is "0" but the actual one is "19.00" (DiscountTS)`

10. *Change* the test scenario accordingly and run the test again to check the successful execution.

11. Optionally, add other rows to the test scenarios. 

== Appendix: a possible solution

WARNING: *DON'T READ THIS SECTION* try before to solve the challenge with hints provided above.
It's not important if your solution does not work as expected or it's different from the following: the philosophy of this hands on is that you can learn more from a failed attempt than from a "guided" success.
